##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

You will see code something similar to the following:

```
  # needed for older Linux distributions such as Ubuntu 12 or Debian 7
  WGET="wget --no-check-certificate"

  # check if running as root
  if [ "x`id -u`" != "x0" ] ; then
    echo "This script is not being run as root."
    echo "Please run it as root user by using either sudo or su command."
    exit 1
  fi
```
